            "description": "Our annual winter retreat is well underway. We had a week of group meditation and this was well attended, both by residents and visitors just here for the day. This gets 'the meditative ball rolling' and the sangha has now started a cycle of self-retreats so there will be various monastics not visible at different times; not to say that they will be invisible :) The general schedule of pujas is being maintained and we will try and keep the calendar up to date with any changes. By definition the vassa means there is not much happening here in terms of work and projects generally. There are a couple of small jobs here and there but generally all quiet on the dhamma front."
